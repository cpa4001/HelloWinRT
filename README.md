## Description

Longer description explaining the rationale/intent behind the project, what it's good for, and how it works. If the next two subsections are short enough, they can be merged up into this blockâ€”perhaps as bulleted lists.

### Features

- It's TINY. A short README is a good README.
- List other standout qualities that'll make a potential user want to try out your project.

### Issues
Whenever I try to create a project under the template, Windows Console Application (C++/WinRT), I get the following error. I have tried downloading the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension and/or the UWP essentials extension, but this had no success.
